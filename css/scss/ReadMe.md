# Introduction

This is an introduction to the whole document. We recommend reading it **carefully** as it contains *very valuable infomration*. Also any outdated informtion will be ~~striked through~~.

The rest of this document is divided into:
* Section 1 
* Section 2
* Section 3 - Famous quotes
* Section 4 - Code Snippets. Contains of 3 sub-sections:
  1. Sub-section 3.1: HTML example
  2. Sub-section 3.2: JavaScript example
  3. Sub-section 3.3: Java example

* Section 5 - Important tables

# Section One

The first section of the document always comes first. Hence, it is a must to read it directly after the introduction.

# Section Two

The Second section always comes after the first section. ***In some rare cases,*** you can skip reading the first section and start with the second section in case you are already familiar with the topics presented in the first section. However; we do not recommend doing this.

# Section Three
Contains quotes from famous scientists such as
> Time is always irreversible - Albert Einstien

> An Apple is not always red - Sir Eissacc Newton


# Section Four

Contains useful code snippts in various programming languages.

In many of the examples we are using two varaibles `x y` within a function `myFunction` inorder to demoenstrate how to use functions and variables.

~~~ javascript

// Create a function myFucntion

function myFunction (x,y) {
    if (x > y)
        console.log (`The first param: ${x} is greater than the second param: ${y}`);
    else
        console.log (`The first param: ${x} is less than or equal to the second param: ${y}`);
}

~~~ java

// Create a function myFucntion

function myFunction (int x, int y) {
    if (x > y)
        system.out("The first param: " + x + " is greater than the second param: " + "y");
    else
        system.out("The first param: " + x + " is less than or equal to the second param: " + "y");

}
